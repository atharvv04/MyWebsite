            <h2>Chess, Time-Turners, and Tea</h2>
            <p>Published on February 5, 2024</p>
            <p>How many people do we walk by every day without knowing anything about them? We sit next to people in class, without even knowing their names, let alone their ambitions, goals or little happinesses. In all earnestness, we might smile at people every day, but we don’t truly know most people around us. 

                To fix this, our team of writers from Ping! decided to spend a few minutes with students of this prestigious fast-paced college– to have a simple conversation. 
                
                As our team scrambled around campus trying to find people who were willing to answer our list of questions, we discovered that each person had their own perspectives on life. Their own spark that burns their flame, their own glint in their eyes. 
                
                Each person's interview tells us something unmistakable about them. These individual dreams, aspirations and goals are strokes of paint that represent the beauty of the canvas of IIIT. 
                
                This project, in a way, is our tribute to the beauty of the people in the campus. We call it our very own Radical Empathy Project, heavily inspired by the podcast of the same name. So sit down, make yourself cosy, and spend 5 minutes of your day with us and all of these beautiful people. 
                
                The first person we got the privilege of interviewing, is his very own character. His laid-back personality and endless jokes make him very endearing. You’ll often see him mull over a chess game, or go into intense debates about anything political. You might catch him around JC, late into the night, a cup of tea in hand, with a group of friends. We interviewed him in one of these “chai-breaks”. </p>

            <h2>Unplugged '23</h2>
            <p>Published on February 5, 2024</p>
            <p>The music club's annual acoustic music event, Unplugged 2023 took place at the Vindhya Canteen on the 30th and 31st of October 2023. Notably, this was the first time it spanned for two days instead of one. I was there on the first day, and I hope you were there too. But, just in case you weren’t, I hope I can paint an image for you.

                It was late into the evening, and the sun had almost completely set. All of VC was illuminated by warm hanging lights. It almost gave me the illusion that the place was lit up by swarms of fireflies. The event lasted well into the night, with musicians playing 1-3 songs each, and then giving way for the next performers. 
                
                If I had to set the scene for you, I'd tell you that it was extremely mellow and calm. This college is known for its swarm of students always working, always moving, always grinding. I got to see all of those unique hard workers slow down for a few hours, and enjoy the pureness of listening to music in a community. It’s truly special to see around 100 people together, just singing their favourite songs. The performers themselves were students from all batches, from UG1 to PhD. 
                
                There were performances from a range of genres, be it carnatic classical, to indie rock. People performed their own renditions of well-loved songs, occasionally adding their own twist to it. We all sang a whole array of songs together, from old hindi gems from Lata Mangeshkar to classic rock staples from the likes of Eric Clapton to recent tunes by well known musicians like Arijit Singh, Ed Sheeran and Prateek Kuhad. Around the canteen, there were stalls from La Pinos, Theka Coffee and Makers of Milkshake, where students, researchers and professors alike could get pizzas, kulfis, milkshakes etc to compliment the music. 
                
                The air was fresh, and the night was young. The tungsten lighting, the breezy laughter, the group singing, it all reminded us that IIIT is more than just its academic records, and renowned research. It’s about the community and the joy and art which we can create together.
                
                The soulful atmosphere continued on the second day made more exuberant by the collaboration with the fashion club. Added to the mellow acoustic vibe from day 1 was a sense of bewitched playfulness, as the audience now involved people dressed up in their favourite Halloween clothes, with the many face paints each telling a different story.
                
                Unplugged was conducted on a scale never seen before. Bands from other colleges such as JNTUH, gig bands from the city such as Zephyr, Alumni and the professors came together to perform melodious renditions of their favourite songs.
                
                The faculty in particular also passed on meaningful messages against war which are always relevant, but especially so in these times of geopolitical tension in the middle east.
                
                At one point in time, as the independent performer Rohit, performed a beautiful bollywood medley the whole crowd clapped and swayed to his music. It is this sense of bringing people together unanimously that in my opinion captures why music is almost magical in what it does.</p>
